# html forms

+ When ever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
"form" element.

+ Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

+ Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.

### There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables,and forms.

+ Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
+  Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
+ Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.

# js Events


Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).


+ Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.

+ When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.

+ You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.

+ The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.
