# Summary .... HTML 
  When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page  In this CLASS  we focus on how to add markup to the text that appears on your pages. You will learn about:
  
  ### Structural markup:
  
  ● the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
  
  ### Semantic markup:
  ● which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on


 ## Headings
 HTML has six "levels" of headings:
 + <h1> is used for main headings
 
 + <h2>  is used for subheadingsIf there are further sections under the subheadings then the
 + 
  <h3> element is used, and so on...

 ## ParagraPHs
 # <p>
 * To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p>tag and closing </p> tag.By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs. *

 ### HTML Text

## SUMMary IntroducIng cSS

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside Xits own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the Xelements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like)

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your Xrules at different elements.


* Declarations are made up of two parts: 

**the properties Xof the element that you want to change, and the  values of those properties . For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.* 
      
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, Xalthough they may appear within an HTML page.

## **SUMMARY BASIC JS INSTRUCTIONS*

  + * A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe
  
  + * Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

  + * Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in  the script. 
  
  + * Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 
  + * JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
  
  strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
  
  + * Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
  
  + * Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
