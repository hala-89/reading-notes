## SUmmAryLists

 + >> ### There are three types of HTML lists: 
    
    
     1-**ordered are lists where each item in the list is numbered*
                 
      [[ <ol>The ordered list is created with the <ol> element.
                
         <li>Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The listands for list item.)]]

     2-**Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).*
     
       [[<Ul>The Uordered list is created with the <Ul> element.
     <li>Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The listands for list item.)]]
     
     3- **Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.*
     
          + [[<dl>The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.

         +  Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements.<dt>This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
         +  <dd>This is used to contain the definition.]]
