# CSS LAYOUT

###  Controlling the position of elements
###  Creating site layouts
###  Designing for different sized screens

###  Building Blocks

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

 - Block-level elements start on a new line .
 
 - Inline elements flow in between surrounding text 

 ### Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is 
known as the containing or parent element.

### controlling the Position of Elements

 CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control 
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute 
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

 To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use 
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom 
and left or right it should be placed. 

1- Fixed Positioning. 
2-Floating Elements.


+ (DIV) elements are often used as containing elements
   to group together sections of a page.

+  Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

+ The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

+  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

+ Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).  

+ Grids help create professional and flexible designs. 

+ CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

+ You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
