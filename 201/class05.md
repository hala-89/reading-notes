 ## HTML Images
 
*  The <img> element is used to add images to a
web page.

*  You must always specify a src attribute to indicate thesource of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.

*  You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

*  Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
 

  ### types of images:

 * JPEG is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception.
 
 * PNG is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression.
 
 *  GIF is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm.
 


  
 ## CSS Color

* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
 
 *  There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:

      * RGB values

          * hex codes

      *  and color names.

*  Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

*  It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

*  CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


## CSS  Text

* There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.

* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.

* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.

* You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.

* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
