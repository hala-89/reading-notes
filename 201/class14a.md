### What are transition 
 A transition occurs when an element changes from one state to another, 

and the browser fills in that state change with a sequence of in-between frames.
 It has a beginning and an end state.

for example:on hover states, or when information on a page is added or removed. 

The hover states might be a subtle change in font color,

 and information on the page might fade from invisible to visible.


### What are Animations?

CSS Animations are a more powerful alternative to transitions.

 Rather than rely on a change from one beginning state to an end state,
  
  animations can be made up of as many in-between states as you like,
  
   and offer more control over how the states are animated.

## Transitions vs Animations

Transitions for creating a smooth transition from one state to another,

 and animations for more complex series of movements.

Transitions are generally easier to create and manage, 

and apply to the majority of situations. If you need more control over animating

 an element through a series of steps, or if the animation needs to begin on load,
 
  then an animation with keyframes might be the better choice.
