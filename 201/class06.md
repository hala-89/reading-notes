## Problem Domain 

### What is the hardest thing about writing code?

## There are many common answers to this question:

+ Learning a new technology
+ Naming things
+ Testing your code
+ Debugging
+ Fixing bugs
+ Making software maintainable


## Objects 

 + An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.

+ In an object, variables are known as properties of the

+ object; functions are known as methods of the object.
Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.

+ JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

+ Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
