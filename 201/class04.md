 
# HTML Links

 #### Links are the defining feature of the web because
  they allow you to move from  one web page 
  to another â€” enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing.


-  Links are created using the (<a>) element.

-  The (<a>) element uses the href attribute to indicate 
the page you are linking to.

- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is 
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

 You can create links to open email programs with an 
email address in the "to" field.

 - You can use the id attribute to target elements within 
a page that can be linked to

# and Intro to CSS Layout

###  Building Blocks

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

 - Block-level elements start on a new line .
 
 - Inline elements flow in between surrounding text 

 ### Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is 
known as the containing or parent element.

### controlling the Position of Elements

 CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control 
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute 
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

* Normal flow  
* Relative Positioning
* Absolute positioning

+ To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use 
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom 
and left or right it should be placed. 

1- Fixed Positioning. 
2-Floating Elements.

# JS Functions

#### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

+ Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task. 
+ Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value.
