  Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office 
  
  quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of.

  Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists,
  
   sociologists  and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything  
   
   from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees
   
    into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.
    
     ‘‘We’re living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity,’’
     
      says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston University who studies how people share information.
      
       ‘‘All of a sudden, we can pick apart the small choices that all of us make, decisions most of us don’t even 
       
       notice, and figure out why some people are so much more effective than everyone else.’’


##  Work groups Vs Teams

* ### Work groups

 are characterized by the least amount of interdependence.

 They are based on organizational or managerial hierarchy.
 
  Work groups may meet periodically to hear and share information.


* ### Teams

are highly interdependent - they plan work, solve problems, make decisions, 

and review progress in service of a specific project.

 Team members need one another to get work done.
