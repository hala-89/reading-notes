## What is chart.js

is away  for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool.

## Why 

 They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly.

 ## How 
A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

# Canvas
## The ((canvas)) element


((canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas))

At first sight a (canvas) looks like the (img) element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the(canvas) element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.


## Drawing text
* fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.


* strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
